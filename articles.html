                    <p>ver wondered how some graphic designers always manage to produce beautiful
                        looking designs for their brochures, website designs, logo designs? Talent…yes, it helps but
                        there
                        are a handful of more important things you can do that will have even complete beginners
                        producing
                        award winning design.</p>

                    <br>

                    Forget everything you’ve ever been told about Graphic Design
                    <p>There are some hard and fast things that graphic designers will insist are to be obeyed. Only use
                        limited fonts on a design for example or never use green on a magazine or book cover as people
                        will
                        not buy it. Stuff and nonsense. You can pretty much do whatever you like but you must apply
                        these
                        STRICT GRAPHIC DESIGN RULES and you will soon be walking away with graphic design
                        silverware.</p>

                    <br>
                    Somewhere on the page you MUST put in a subliminal message
                    <p>This can be done in a multitude of ways for example if you are producing a brochure selling
                        wellington boots then start every paragraph spelling out ‘buy our wellington boots’ or better
                        still
                        ‘you have no choice but to buy our wellington boots now get out your cheque book and buy them –
                        NOW!’</p>

                    <p>I have been questioned by many people to disclose some of the greatest traffic generating
                        techniques that I know of. I am not to immediate to reveal them because I know the majority
                        doesn’t even take battle on them. All I know is that they work and you should be familiar with
                        this too.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Let’s find to them! My first and foremost form of traffic comes from the higher ranked pages. My
                        link is on web’s most popular sites. You should be able to be part of those famous sites. Do not
                        waste your time in submitting your link anywhere blindly. You must show up your creative work.
                        Going for link partners just to gain a few ranks, is a hard work.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Advertising is key factor in your web site promotion. Let people talk about you, your products,
                        and your services. You see, people are always on the look out for good content right? Your site
                        should have really good contents. Don’t write “Welcome to my website” or “Ours is a World’s
                        first company…blah blah” unless and until you really have dominating product. You sell your
                        products or services as like others, but you think you must be noticed. Your offer should be
                        different to attract visitor. Your presentation should be mind catching. Get aware of
                        advertisers online. There are few major players around</p>
